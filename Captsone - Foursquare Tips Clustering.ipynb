For example, the lemma of \"was\" is \"be\", and the lemma of \"rats\" is \"rat\".\n```\n\nThis should allow the vectorizer to assign similar values to words from the same group but with slightly different form.\n\nI am passing the generated data to the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm which is a faster variant of the K-means (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#mini-batch-kmeans)\n\n```\nThe MiniBatchKMeans is a variant of the KMeans algorithm which uses mini-batches to reduce the computation time, while still attempting to optimise the same objective function. Mini-batches are subsets of the input data, randomly sampled in each training iteration. \n```\n\n### Sentiment analysis\n\nFor the sentiment analysis part I am using the `textblob` library to extract the sentiment from each tip.\n\nThe sentiment, according to the documentation is: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html#textblob.blob.TextBlob.sentiment\n\n```\nReturn a tuple of form (polarity, subjectivity ) where polarity is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0] and subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective.\n```\n\nAfter extracting the sentiments I'm going to compute the average polarity score for all the sentiment and for objective sentiments only.",
